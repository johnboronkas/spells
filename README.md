# TODO
- Pits (shoot over, but can't walk over)
- Shields (move over, but can't shoot over)
- Blocking/reflecting spell
- Camera Movement / Larger maps
- Health and Mana (no health regen, slow mana regen)
- Sprinting costs mana
- Sheild costs a lot of mana per time spent up (doesn't lose more if hit by a spell or anything)
- Capture point and regen/respawn points (associated to nearby capture point)
- Basic AI
- Levels / Experience (per damage done, extra exp for a kill)
- Player level ups (start with 3 skill points, gain 3 skill points per rank up)
- Ranks are Peon (3), Captain (6), Officer (9), Lieutenant (12), General (15)
- XP is expoitital both up and down the rank chart (ie, an Officer would need to damage like 12 captains to level up, but only 3 lieutenants)
- Ranks are shown as as a pre-fix to player's nickname (Peons shown with no name, Captains shown as just Captain, all others shown as Officer SomeName)
- Mutliplayer
- Dynisty Warriors style game play (with kill counter)
- Show unit count for each side and number of officers, lieutenants, and generals (per side)
- Kills of Officers, Lieutenants, and Generals are announced globaly (both the killer and the killed)
- Advanced AI (each side should have a varity of differently skilled AI)

# Bugs
