# controllers

- Controllers implement ControllerDefinitions for behaviours
- Controllers can either be human controlled or AI controlled based on the implementation
- Controllers may require specific components for the prefab they are attached to in order perform their controlling
- They get passed the behaviour's state in order to have the information they need to act with
